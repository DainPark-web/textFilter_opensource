DainPark/Textfilter is the simplest way to analyze text and visualize the data. You can get data about your text, how many words or sentences were used, and easily visualize this data.
Besides, There are a lot of functions to analyze the text in more detail. You can find more information to use this tool in Readme.md

When my team was working to analyze the text, they had a problem with it because there wasn't a proper tool. For that, I made this tool to work conveniently and productively.

Still, we are using this tool regularly for ourselves. I hope you will too.
If you want to contribute, issues and PRs are welcome.
